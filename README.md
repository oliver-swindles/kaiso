# kaiso
Kaiso is a Social Media app currently in development by Oliver Swindles.

It uses Google's Firebase for all its backend services such as Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore, and in the near future, Firebase Storage.

The project is currently only available to use fully on my local machine and has not yet been uploaded to Firebase Hosting, when it does I will make sure to
leave the website URL here so you can check it out ( and maybe even sign up to use the app : O )
